## Problem Statement

In Major League Baseball being able to predict a player's career length and identify the turning point of performance decline.

## Potential Clients

Potential clients would be MLB teams considering trading or signing players and sports agents representing these players.  Being able to predict the efficacy of a player at certain points in their career would help determine how long a contract should be drafted for and a reasonable salary for the player in question.

## Dataset
The dataset I would use is the Lahman Baseball Database.  See <http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics>.  The data is in .csv format and contains statistics from 1871 through the 2016 baseball season.
